What is it?
-----------

Xenon is a middleware abstraction library. It provides a simple 
programming interface to various pieces of software that can be used
to access distributed compute and storage resources. 


Why Xenon?
----------

Xenon is developed by the Netherlands eScience Center as a support
library for our projects. Several projects develop end-user 
applications that require access to distributed compute and storage
resources. Xenon provides a simple API to those resources, allowing
those applications to be developed more rapidly. The experience 
gained during end-user application development is used to improve 
the Xenon API and implementation.
