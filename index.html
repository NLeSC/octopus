    <a name="what-is-it" class="anchor" href="#what-is-it"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is it?</h2>

    <p>Xenon is a middleware abstraction library. It provides a simple programming
    interface to various pieces of software that can be used to access distributed
    compute and storage resources. </p>

    <h2>
    <a name="why-Xenon" class="anchor" href="#why-Xenon"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why Xenon?</h2>

    <p>Xenon is developed by the Netherlands eScience Center as a support library
    for our projects. Several projects develop end-user applications that require
    access to distributed compute and storage resources. Xenon provides a simple
    API to those resources, allowing those applications to be developed more
    rapidly. The experience gained during end-user application development is used
    to improve the Xenon API and implementation. </p>
